This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It’s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you’re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It’s completely free! If you’re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I’m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.","featured":false,"features":null,"free_preview_enabled":false,"full_course_available":true,"graduate_groups":["6449244402089984"],"hero_video":"","hero_video_poster":"","hero_video_id":"","hiring_affiliates":null,"image":"https://d20vrrgs8k4bvw.cloudfront.net/images/courses/thumbnails/cs222_thumbnail.jpg","instructors":[{"bio":"\u003cp\u003eJörn Loviscach is a professor of technical mathematics and computer engineering.

This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace.

This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you’re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It’s completely free! If you’re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I’m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.","featured":false,"features":null,"free_preview_enabled":false,"full_course_available":true,"graduate_groups":["6146550401597440"],"hero_video":"","hero_video_poster":"","hero_video_id":"","hiring_affiliates":null,"image":"https://d20vrrgs8k4bvw.cloudfront.net/images/courses/thumbnails/cs259_thumbnail.jpg","instructors":[{"bio":"\u003cp\u003eAndreas Zeller is a computer science professor at Saarland University, Germany.

This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It’s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you’re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It’s completely free! If you’re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I’m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.","featured":false,"features":null,"free_preview_enabled":false,"full_course_available":false,"graduate_groups":[],"hero_video":"","hero_video_poster":"","hero_video_id":"","hiring_affiliates":null,"image":"https://d20vrrgs8k4bvw.cloudfront.net/images/courses/thumbnails/cs313_thumbnail.jpg","instructors":[{"bio":"\u003cp\u003eSebastian studied Bioinformatics at Universität Tübingen and holds a Ph.D. from Universität Jena in Germany, where his research focused on finding efficient algorithms for computationally hard problems on biological networks.

The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you’re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It’s completely free! If you’re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I’m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.","featured":false,"features":null,"free_preview_enabled":false,"full_course_available":true,"graduate_groups":["5190131097534464"],"hero_video":"","hero_video_poster":"","hero_video_id":"","hiring_affiliates":null,"image":"https://d20vrrgs8k4bvw.cloudfront.net/images/courses/thumbnails/cs387_thumbnail.jpg","instructors":[{"bio":"\u003cp\u003eDave Evans is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Virginia where he teaches computer science and leads research in computer security.

If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you’re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I’m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.","featured":false,"features":null,"free_preview_enabled":false,"full_course_available":true,"graduate_groups":["4918667695882240"],"hero_video":"","hero_video_poster":"","hero_video_id":"","hiring_affiliates":null,"image":"https://d20vrrgs8k4bvw.cloudfront.net/images/courses/thumbnails/ep245_thumbnail.jpg","instructors":[{"bio":"\u003cp\u003eSteve Blank is a seasoned Silicon Valley entrepreneur.

This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It’s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you’re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It’s completely free! If you’re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn.

This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It’s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you’re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It’s completely free! If you’re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I’m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.","featured":false,"features":null,"free_preview_enabled":false,"full_course_available":false,"graduate_groups":[],"hero_video":"","hero_video_poster":"","hero_video_id":"","hiring_affiliates":null,"image":"https://d20vrrgs8k4bvw.cloudfront.net/images/courses/thumbnails/st101_thumbnail.jpg","instructors":[{"bio":"\u003cp\u003eAs the founder and president of Udacity, Sebastian’s mission is to democratize education.
